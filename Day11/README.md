## Problem Statement

You are given three integers **a**, **b**, and **c**.  
Your task is to determine whether **one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two**.

---

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer **t**  
  *(1 ≤ t ≤ 9261)* — the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of three integers **a**, **b**, and **c**  
  *(0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 20)*.

---

## Output

For each test case:
- Output **`YES`** if **one of the numbers equals the sum of the other two**.
- Otherwise, output **`NO`**.

The output is **case-insensitive**, so `YES`, `yes`, `Yes`, etc., are all valid.
