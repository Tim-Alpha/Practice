# A. Lucky?

**Time Limit:** 1 second  
**Memory Limit:** 256 megabytes  

A ticket is a string consisting of **six digits**.  
A ticket is considered **lucky** if the **sum of the first three digits** is equal to the **sum of the last three digits**.

Note: A ticket **may contain leading zeroes**.

---

## Input

- The first line contains an integer **t**  
  \(1 \le t \le 10^3\) — the number of test cases.
- Each of the next **t** lines contains a string of exactly **six digits**.

---

## Output

For each test case, output:

- `"YES"` if the ticket is lucky  
- `"NO"` otherwise  

The output is **case-insensitive**, so `"yes"`, `"Yes"`, `"YES"` are all valid.
