# A. Division?

**Time limit per test:** 1 second  
**Memory limit per test:** 256 megabytes  

Codeforces separates its users into **4 divisions** based on their rating:

- **Division 1:** `rating ≥ 1900`
- **Division 2:** `1600 ≤ rating ≤ 1899`
- **Division 3:** `1400 ≤ rating ≤ 1599`
- **Division 4:** `rating ≤ 1399`

---

## Input

- The first line contains an integer `t`  
  (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

- Each of the next `t` lines contains one integer `rating`  
  (`-5000 ≤ rating ≤ 5000`).

---

## Output

For each test case, print a single line in the format:
