## Problem Statement

The New Year holidays are over, and Santa Claus along with his colleagues can finally relax and welcome guests. When two **New Year and Christmas Men** meet, their assistants cut cardboard letters from the guest’s name and the host’s name and hang them above the main entrance.

One night, after everyone went to bed, someone took all these letters, shuffled them, and left them in one pile in front of the door.

The next morning, nobody could find the culprit. However, everyone wondered:

> Is it possible to restore the names of the host and the guest using **exactly** the letters found in the pile — no extra letters and no missing ones?

Your task is to help determine whether this is possible.

## Input

The input consists of **three lines**:

1. The guest’s name  
2. The host’s name  
3. The pile of letters found at the door  

**Constraints:**
- All lines are non-empty
- Each line contains only **uppercase Latin letters**
- Length of each line ≤ 100

## Output

- Print **`YES`** if the letters in the pile can be rearranged to form exactly the guest’s name and the host’s name combined.
- Otherwise, print **`NO`**.
