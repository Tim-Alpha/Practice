# B. Blank Space

**Time limit per test:** 1 second  
**Memory limit per test:** 256 megabytes  

You are given a binary array `a` of length `n`.  
A binary array is an array consisting only of `0`s and `1`s.

A **blank space** is a segment of consecutive elements consisting of only `0`s.

Your task is to find the length of the **longest blank space**.

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`) — the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100`) — the length of the array.
- The second line of each test case contains `n` space-separated integers `a_i` (`0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1`) — the elements of the array.

---

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest blank space.
