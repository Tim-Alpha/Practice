# A. Odd One Out

**Time Limit:** 1 second  
**Memory Limit:** 256 megabytes  

## Problem Description

You are given three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.  

Two of them are equal, but the third one is different from the other two.

Your task is to find and print the value that occurs **exactly once**.

---

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer `t`  
  `(1 ≤ t ≤ 270)` — the number of test cases.

- Each test case contains three digits `a`, `b`, `c`  
  `(0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9)`.

It is guaranteed that **exactly two digits are equal** and one digit is different.

---

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer —  
the value that occurs exactly once.
