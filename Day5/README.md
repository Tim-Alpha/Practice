Little Petya very much likes gifts. Recently, he received a new laptop as a New Year gift from his mother. He immediately decided to give it to somebody else, as what can be more pleasant than giving somebody gifts? On this occasion, he organized a New Year party at his place and invited **n** of his friends.

If there’s one thing Petya likes more than receiving gifts, it’s watching others give gifts to somebody else. Thus, he safely hid the laptop until the next New Year and decided to watch his friends exchange gifts while he did not participate in the process.

He numbered all his friends with integers from **1** to **n**. Petya remembered that friend number **i** gave a gift to friend number **pᵢ**. He also remembered that each of his friends received **exactly one gift**.

Now Petya wants to know, for each friend **i**, the number of the friend who has given him a gift.

## Input

- The first line contains one integer **n** (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of friends Petya invited to the party.
- The second line contains **n** space-separated integers.  
  The **i-th** number is **pᵢ** — the number of the friend who gave a gift to friend **i**.

It is guaranteed that each friend received exactly one gift.  
Some friends may have given gifts to themselves.

## Output

Print **n** space-separated integers.  
The **i-th** number should be the number of the friend who gave a gift to friend **i**.
