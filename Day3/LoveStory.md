# A. Love Story

**Time limit per test:** 1 second  
**Memory limit per test:** 256 megabytes

Timur loves Codeforces. That’s why he has a string **s** of length **10**, containing only lowercase Latin letters. Timur wants to know how many indices the string **s** differs from the string **"codeforces"**.

For example, the string  
**s = "coolforsez"**  
differs from **"codeforces"** in **4** indices (shown in bold).

Help Timur by finding the number of indices where string **s** differs from **"codeforces"**.

⚠️ Note: You **cannot reorder** the characters in the string **s**.

---

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer **t**  
  \((1 \le t \le 1000)\) — the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of one line containing the string **s**, consisting of exactly **10** lowercase Latin characters.

---

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of indices where the string **s** differs from **"codeforces"**.
